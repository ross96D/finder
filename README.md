## First idea
The thing is i am not very confortable on how vscode integrate with ripgrep. The issues are that i cannot use the keyboard to do this and i dont have a nice preview.. so.. the initial idea (due to the vscode plugins limitations) create a window that let me implement all this features.. the window will be called with an exec and returns the selected part to vscode so the extension can tell vscode where to go 

- maybe is better to use C for this project and not a wrapper arround it, or maybe is better to use ebitengine
